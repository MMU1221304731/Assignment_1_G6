abstract = {Abstract Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks represent a significant cybersecurity challenge, posing a critical risk to computer networks. Developing an effective defense mechanism against these attacks is crucial but challenging, given their diverse attack types, network and computing platform heterogeneity, and complex communication protocols. Moreover, the emergence of innovative DDoS attack methods presents a formidable threat to existing countermeasures. Various machine learning techniques have shown promise in detecting DDoS attacks with low false-positive rates and high detection rates. This survey paper offers a comprehensive taxonomy of machine learning-based methods for detecting DDoS attacks, reviewing supervised, unsupervised, hybrid approaches, and analyzing the related challenges. Further, we explore relevant datasets, highlighting their strengths and limitations, and propose future research directions to address the current gaps in this domain. This paper aims to provide a profound understanding of DDoS attack detection mechanisms, aiding researchers, and practitioners in developing effective cybersecurity approaches against such attacks. This research is essential because DDoS attacks are diverse and pose a formidable threat to computer networks, and various machine learning techniques have shown promise in detecting them. Its implications include providing insights that can inform the development of robust defense mechanisms against DDoS attacks.},

  abstract={This state-of-the-art review comprehensively examines the landscape of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) anomaly detection in Software Defined Networks (SDNs) through the lens of advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The application domain of this work is focused on addressing the inherent security vulnerabilities of SDN environments and developing an automated system for detecting and mitigating network attacks. The problem focused on in this review is the need for effective defensive mechanisms and detection methodologies to address these vulnerabilities. Conventional network measurement methodologies are limited in the context of SDNs, and the proposed ML and DL techniques aim to overcome these limitations by providing more accurate and efficient detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks. The objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive review of related works in the field of SDN anomaly detection recent advances, categorized into two groups via ML and DL techniques. The proposed systems utilize a variety of techniques, including Supervised Learning (SL), Unsupervised Learning (UL) Ensemble Learning (EL) and DL solutions, to process IP flows, profile network traffic, and identify attacks. The output comprises the mitigation policies learned by ML/DL techniques, and the proposed systems act as sophisticated gatekeepers, applying automated mitigation policies to curtail the extent of damage resulting from these attacks. The results obtained from the evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, confirm the marked effectiveness of the proposed systems in detecting and mitigating various types of attacks, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The proposed systems’ foundational contributions are manifest in their efficacy for both DDoS attack detection and defense within the SDN environment. However, the review acknowledges certain inherent limitations and the pressing need for further validation within real-world scenarios to assess the proposed methods’ practicality and effectiveness. In summary, this systematic review offers valuable perspectives on the present status of Distributed Denial-of-Service detection in Software-Defined Networks employing Machine Learning and Deep Learning methodologies, highlighting the strengths and limitations of various proposed systems and identifying areas for future research and development.},

abstract = {Abstract Software-defined networking (SDN) has received considerable attention and adoption owing to its inherent advantages, such as enhanced scalability, increased adaptability, and the ability to exercise centralized control. However, the control plane of the system is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which are a primary focus for attackers. These attacks have the potential to result in substantial delays and packet loss. In this study, we present a novel system called Two-Phase Authentication for Attack Detection that aims to enhance the security of SDN by mitigating DoS attacks. The methodology utilized in our study involves the implementation of packet filtration and machine learning classification techniques, which are subsequently followed by the targeted restriction of malevolent network traffic. Instead of completely deactivating the host, the emphasis lies on preventing harmful communication. Support vector machine and K-nearest neighbours algorithms were utilized for efficient detection on the CICDoS 2017 dataset. The deployed model was utilized within an environment designed for the identification of threats in SDN. Based on the observations of the banned queue, our system allows a host to reconnect when it is no longer contributing to malicious traffic. The experiments were run on a VMware Ubuntu, and an SDN environment was created using Mininet and the RYU controller. The results of the tests demonstrated enhanced performance in various aspects, including the reduction of false positives, the minimization of central processing unit utilization and control channel bandwidth consumption, the improvement of packet delivery ratio, and the decrease in the number of flow requests submitted to the controller. These results confirm that our Two-Phase Authentication for Attack Detection architecture identifies and mitigates SDN DoS attacks with low overhead.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a complicated security feature in which datagrams are protected by integrity, confidentiality, and authentication services. The network is protected from external interruptions and intrusions. Because IoT devices run with a range of heterogeneous technologies and process data over time, standard solutions may not be practical. It is necessary to develop intelligent procedures that can be used for multiple levels of data flow in the system. This study examines metainnovations using deep learning-based IDS. Per the findings of the earlier tests, BiLSTMs are better for binary (regular/attacker) classification; however, sequential models (LSTM or BiLSTM) are better for detecting some brutal attacks in multiclass classifiers. According to experts, deep learning-based intrusion detection systems can now recognize and select the best structure for each category. However, specific difficulties will need to be solved in the future. Two topics should be studied further in future attempts. One of the researchers’ concerns is the impact of various data processing techniques, such as artificial intelligence or metamethods, on IDS. The BiLSTM approach has chosen the safest instances with the highest accuracy among the models. According to the findings, the most reliable and suitable solution for evaluating DDoS attacks in IoT is the BiLSTM design.},

abstract = {As the use of devices in mobile environments increases, network attacks such as DDoS have a malicious attempt to flood the network's regular traffic to overload the target and surrounding infrastructure. This research proposed machine learning and deep learning approaches to dealing with DDoS attacks, and the results are described as follows. First, this research successfully detected DDoS attacks through an LGBM with a 100\% accuracy score. Second, the proposed model (GRU-LM), which consists of a trained Word2vec layer with the Python dataset, is far more effective than the standard GRU model. Since Python is quite similar to English, language model-based GRU yields superior results. Various preprocessing steps were performed through the NLTK package, and each number was assigned to the tokenized one for constructing the GRU language model. The result reveals that the proposed model achieved an accuracy score of 87\% for predicting the following words in the source code, while the rest achieved below 30\% accuracy. This conclusion is significant because its relatively simple and light structure overcomes tradeoff problems between time and accuracy and is adaptable to the mobile setting. Discovering traffic patterns for the underlying data of DDOS assaults and retrieving them using statistical data analysis is the value of this research. Furthermore, since public cloud application vulnerability assaults are rising due to expanding cloud infrastructure, this finding could be used in such attacks.},
